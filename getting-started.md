* **Client** is the admin or the owner of several FaceGallery. The lient is your program (application) that is accessing our API. The client may have access to multiple FaceGallery.
* **FaceGallery** is a collection of users from a place or area. Think of it as a “database”.
* **User** is the person who uses the API for recognition. User will give their **face** (to be exact) in the database.

## 4. Create New Facegallery



FaceGallery is a collection of users, please refer to this [API ](apis/face-api.md#post-facegallery-create-facegallery)to make a new Facegallery.
